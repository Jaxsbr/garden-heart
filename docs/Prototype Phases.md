# Heart of the Garden: Development Milestones

This is a breakdown of easily achievable milestones to keep you motivated during the development of "Heart of the Garden," a strategy-defense game.

## Phase 1: Core Mechanics

### Basic Entity System:
- Implement a simple Entity-Component-System (ECS) for even basic objects (Protector, Heart, basic enemy).
- Ensure basic movement and collision detection work within this system.

### Prototype Planting:
- Create a single plant type (e.g., a simple wall) with basic planting and growth mechanics.
- Implement a rudimentary watering system.

### Basic Enemy Behavior:
- Create a single enemy type with basic movement towards the Heart.
- Implement simple collision detection with the Heart and plants.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions:
- Implement basic victory (all enemies defeated) and defeat (Heart destroyed) conditions.

## Phase 2: Gameplay Refinement

### Multiple Plant Types:
- Add at least two more plant types with unique defensive properties (e.g., damage over time, slow).

### Enemy Variety:
- Add at least one more enemy type with different movement patterns or attacks.

### Basic Upgrades:
- Implement a single upgrade for the Protector (e.g., increased movement speed).

### Level Progression:
- Create a single, simple level with increasing enemy waves.

## Phase 3: Polish and Expansion

### User Interface (UI):
- Implement a basic UI for displaying game information (health, energy, time).
- Create a simple menu for selecting plants and viewing upgrades.

### Sound and Visuals:
- Add basic sound effects (plant growth, enemy attacks, etc.).
- Improve the visual appearance of the game world.

### Profile System:
- Implement basic profile creation and selection functionality.

## Important Considerations:

- **Keep it Simple**: Focus on core gameplay mechanics first. Avoid over-complicating things in the early stages.
- **Regular Testing**: Playtest your game frequently to identify and fix bugs and areas for improvement.
- **Don't Be Afraid to Iterate**: Experiment with different mechanics and balance adjustments.

## Bonus:
- Consider using a version control system (like Git) to track your progress and easily revert changes if needed.

By focusing on these smaller, achievable milestones, you'll maintain momentum and gradually build a more complex and engaging game.
